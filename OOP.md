**`Introduction of Object Oriented Programming`**

# What is OOP?

OOPs is the languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming main point is to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

OOPs Concepts:

    1. Class
    2. Objects
    3. Data Abstraction 
    4. Encapsulation
    5. Inheritance
    6. Polymorphism

---

### 1. Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects...

### 2. Object
An object is an instance of a class...

### 3. Abstraction
Only relevant information is exposed, hiding complex details...

### 4. Encapsulation
Data and methods are wrapped into a single unit...

### 5. Inheritance
Allows reuse of code across different classes...

### 6. Polymorphism
Allows methods to behave differently based on context...

# What is OOP Used For?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is widely used in the development of modern software systems because of its ability to model complex real-world problems in a structured and reusable way. OOP is used for:

    Developing large-scale applications: OOP makes it easier to manage, scale, and maintain large codebases.

    Building reusable components: Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of an application or even across projects.

    Designing real-world models: OOP allows developers to represent real-world entities (like users, vehicles, products) through objects.

    Creating secure software: Through encapsulation and data hiding, sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.

    Improving collaboration in teams: With well-defined classes and interfaces, multiple developers can work on different parts of a project independently.

    Game and GUI development: OOP is ideal for developing interactive systems like games and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

    Web and mobile apps: Frameworks like Spring (Java), Django (Python), and Swift (iOS) use OOP principles to build responsive and maintainable applications.

# Conclusion

Through studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, I have gained a strong understanding of how to model real-world systems using classes and objects. I learned about the four main pillars of OOP — abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism — and how they help in building scalable, reusable, and maintainable code. I now understand how data and behavior can be bundled together to create modular programs, how access to internal data can be restricted for security, and how code can be reused and extended across classes. By applying these concepts with Java examples, I have also developed a clearer picture of how OOP supports real-world application development. Overall, learning OOP has strengthened my programming foundation and equipped me with skills that are essential for modern software development.
